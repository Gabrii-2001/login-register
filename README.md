## 📝 Usage

### Authentication Forms

The authentication forms allow users to log in or register easily. The forms validate inputs in real-time, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Form Validation

Using libraries like **Formik** and **Yup**, we validate user inputs to prevent errors and enhance security.

### OTP Verification

After registration, users receive a one-time password (OTP) via email. This step ensures that the user’s email is valid and adds a layer of security.

### Password Reset

Users can request a password reset link, which will be sent to their registered email. This process is simple and user-friendly.

1. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
2. Import your GitHub repository.
3. Configure your environment variables as needed.
4. Click "Deploy".

Your application will be live in just a few minutes!
